Week 1, Homework 1, Portfolio

I've created this Portfolio web page using Bootsrap and customized a bit with CSS. index.html is home page and shell for everything. Basically, I created index.html first and used it as template for the rest of the .html files and connected them together using "link rel". This portfolio web page is fully repsonsive with working nav menu and with contact email checker too. Also, note that this web page has Bootstrap grid system.

Doing this project after HW1 was great because now I know how everything laid out and if I needed something I would reference back to my first portfolio web page.
